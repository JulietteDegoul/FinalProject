Predicting the success of IndieGogo campaigns with Machine Learning - by Ilkay MÃ¼ller & Juliette Degoul


Crowdfunding platforms such as Indiegogo have revolutionized the way individuals and businesses raise funds for their projects. However, launching a successful crowdfunding campaign is not an easy task. Campaign creators face challenges such as identifying the optimal funding goal, crafting an effective campaign title, and finding the perfect time to launch their campaign. 

Our project aims to help campaign owners overcome these challenges by developing a machine learning model that predicts the success of an Indiegogo campaign. By accurately predicting the success of a campaign, campaign owners can make informed decisions about various aspects of their campaign, such as the funding goal, and the duration of the campaign. This will help them optimize their campaigns and increase the chances of success. Ultimately, our project aims to empower campaign owners with data-driven insights that can lead to more successful campaigns and bring their innovative ideas to life.
